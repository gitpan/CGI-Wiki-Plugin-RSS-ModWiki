Currently this is very simple and only emits the last 15 changes,
major or minor. There are interesting parameters at
http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiPatches/XmlRss that I will
get around to implementing at some point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't yet worked out how to make XML::RSS emit, for example,

        <rss:channel rdf:about="http://openwiki.com">
            ...
            <wiki:interwiki>
                <rdf:Description rss:link="http://openwiki.com/?">
                    <rdf:value>OpenWiki</rdf:value>
                </rdf:Description>
            </wiki:interwiki>
        </rss:channel>

instead of

        <rss:channel rdf:about="http://openwiki.com">
            ...
            <wiki:interwiki>OpenWiki</wiki:interwiki>
        </rss:channel>

So the following things specified at
  http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ModWiki
aren't yet implemented:

  interwiki prefix
  host of contributor
  URI link for contributor


It does however seem (see
http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ModWikiDiscussion) that maybe this
syntax doesn't need to be supported. There is also a lot of other
discussion on that page about things that don't seem to have settled
down, so I'm not going to try implementing them yet.
