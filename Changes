        Use <foaf:maker> instead of <dc:creator> for reasons detailed at
          http://rdfweb.org/topic/UsingDublinCoreCreator .
        Fix dates that weren't in W3C Date and Time Format.
        Change XML namespace "wiki" to be "modwiki"; change URL of namespace
          to something that doesn't produce a useless 404 error (causing
          feeds to fail at feedvalidator.org).

        <dc:creator> was incorrectly specified as <dc:Creator>.

        IMPORTANT CHANGE: There is a new _mandatory_ parameter for
          invoking this module - site_url. This should be the URL of the
          site whose RSS feed you are creating.
        New options for DOAP (http://usefulinc.com/doap) metadata.
        Drop "ignore_minor_changes". (I told you it was deprecated.)

        Make sure node names are XML-safe.
        Get rid of warnings when tests are run.
        
0.072   23 July 2005
        Change name of recent_changes() argument from "ignore_minor_changes"
        to "ignore_minor_edits" for consistency with OpenGuides. The old 
        name is still supported for the moment, but is deprecated.

        Added missing Changes file to MANIFEST.

0.02    4 May 2003
        Added 'items' and 'days' arguments to ->recent_changes - so you can
          ask for 'the last 20 changes', or 'all changes in the past 7 days'.
        Added username in with the description - it's nice to see easily *who*
          made a change.

0.01    6 April 2003
        Initial release.
